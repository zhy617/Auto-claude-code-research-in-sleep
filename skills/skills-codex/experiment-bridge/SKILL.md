# Workflow 1.5: Experiment Bridge

Implement and deploy experiments from plan: **$ARGUMENTS**

## Overview

This skill bridges Workflow 1 (idea discovery + method refinement) and Workflow 2 (auto review loop). It takes the experiment plan and turns it into running experiments with initial results.

```
Workflow 1 output:                    This skill:                        Workflow 2 input:
refine-logs/EXPERIMENT_PLAN.md   →   implement → deploy → collect   →   initial results ready
refine-logs/EXPERIMENT_TRACKER.md     code        /run-experiment        for /auto-review-loop
refine-logs/FINAL_PROPOSAL.md
```

## Constants

- **AUTO_DEPLOY = true** — Automatically deploy experiments after implementation. Set `false` to review code before deploying.
- **SANITY_FIRST = true** — Run the sanity-stage experiment first (smallest, fastest) before launching the rest. Catches setup bugs early.
- **MAX_PARALLEL_RUNS = 4** — Maximum number of experiments to deploy in parallel (limited by available GPUs).
- **BASE_REPO = false** — GitHub repo URL to use as a base codebase. When set, clone it first and implement experiments on top of it.
- **COMPACT = false** — When `true`, prefer `IDEA_CANDIDATES.md` over the full `IDEA_REPORT.md`, and append completed runs to `EXPERIMENT_LOG.md`.

> Override: `/experiment-bridge "EXPERIMENT_PLAN.md" — compact: true, base repo: https://github.com/org/project`

## Inputs

This skill expects one or more of:

1. **`refine-logs/EXPERIMENT_PLAN.md`** (best) — claim-driven experiment roadmap from `/experiment-plan`
2. **`refine-logs/EXPERIMENT_TRACKER.md`** — run-by-run execution table
3. **`refine-logs/FINAL_PROPOSAL.md`** — method description for implementation context
4. **`IDEA_CANDIDATES.md`** — compact idea summary (preferred when `COMPACT = true`)
5. **`IDEA_REPORT.md`** — fallback if refine-logs don't exist

If none exist, ask the user what experiments to implement.

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Parse the Experiment Plan

Read `EXPERIMENT_PLAN.md` and extract:

1. **Run order and milestones** — which experiments run first (sanity → baseline → main → ablation → polish)
2. **For each experiment block:**
   - Dataset / split / task
   - Compared systems and variants
   - Metrics to compute
   - Setup details (backbone, hyperparameters, seeds)
   - Success criterion
   - Priority (MUST-RUN vs NICE-TO-HAVE)
3. **Compute budget** — total estimated GPU-hours
4. **Method details** from `FINAL_PROPOSAL.md` — what exactly to implement

Present a brief summary:

```
📋 Experiment plan loaded:
- Milestones: [N] (sanity → baseline → main → ablation)
- Must-run experiments: [N]
- Nice-to-have: [N]
- Estimated GPU-hours: [X]

Proceeding to implementation.
```

### Phase 2: Implement Experiment Code

**If `BASE_REPO` is set** — clone the repo first:

```bash
git clone <BASE_REPO> base_repo/
```

For each milestone (in order), write the experiment scripts:

1. **Check existing code** — scan the project (or cloned `base_repo/`) for existing experiment scripts, model code, and data loaders. Reuse as much as possible.

2. **Implement missing pieces:**
   - Training scripts with proper argparse (all hyperparameters configurable)
   - Evaluation scripts computing the specified metrics
   - Data loading / preprocessing if needed
   - Baseline implementations if not already present
   - Fixed random seeds for reproducibility
   - Results saved to JSON/CSV for later analysis
   - Proper logging (wandb if configured in AGENTS.md)

3. **Follow the plan's run order** — implement sanity-stage experiments first, then baselines, then main method, then ablations.

4. **Self-review before deploying:**
   - Are all hyperparameters from EXPERIMENT_PLAN.md reflected in argparse?
   - Is the random seed fixed and controllable?
   - Are results saved in a parseable format (JSON/CSV)?
   - Does the code match FINAL_PROPOSAL.md's method description?
   - **CRITICAL**: does evaluation compare predictions against dataset ground truth, never another model's output?

### Phase 3: Sanity Check (if SANITY_FIRST = true)

Before deploying the full experiment suite, run the sanity-stage experiment:

```
/run-experiment [sanity experiment command]
```

Wait for completion. Verify:
- Training loop runs without errors
- Metrics are computed and saved correctly
- GPU memory usage is within bounds
- Output format matches expectations

If sanity fails → fix the code, re-run. Do not proceed to full deployment with broken code.

### Phase 4: Deploy Full Experiments

Deploy experiments following the plan's milestone order:

```
/run-experiment [experiment commands]
```

For each milestone:
1. Deploy experiments in parallel (up to MAX_PARALLEL_RUNS)
2. Use `/monitor-experiment` to track progress
3. Collect results as experiments complete

**🚦 Checkpoint (if AUTO_DEPLOY = false):**

```
🔧 Code implementation complete. Ready to deploy:

Milestone 0 (sanity): [status — passed/pending]
Milestone 1 (baseline): [N experiments, ~X GPU-hours]
Milestone 2 (main method): [N experiments, ~X GPU-hours]
Milestone 3 (ablations): [N experiments, ~X GPU-hours]

Total estimated: ~X GPU-hours on [N] GPUs

Deploy now? Or review the code first?
```

### Phase 5: Collect Initial Results

As experiments complete:

1. **Parse output files** (JSON/CSV/logs) for key metrics
2. **Training quality check** — if W&B data is available, invoke `/training-check` to detect NaN, loss divergence, plateaus, or overfitting. If W&B is not configured, skip silently.
3. **Update `refine-logs/EXPERIMENT_TRACKER.md`** — fill in Status and Notes columns
4. **Check success criteria** from EXPERIMENT_PLAN.md — did each experiment meet its bar?
5. **Write initial results summary:**

```markdown
# Initial Experiment Results

**Date**: [today]
**Plan**: refine-logs/EXPERIMENT_PLAN.md

## Results by Milestone

### M0: Sanity — PASSED
- [result]

### M1: Baselines
| Run | System | Key Metric | Status |
|-----|--------|-----------|--------|
| R001 | baseline_1 | X.XX | DONE |

### M2: Main Method
| Run | System | Key Metric | Status |
|-----|--------|-----------|--------|
| R003 | our_method | X.XX | DONE |

### M3: Ablations
...

## Summary
- [X/Y] must-run experiments completed
- Main result: [positive/negative/inconclusive]
- Ready for /auto-review-loop: [YES/NO]

## Next Step
→ /auto-review-loop "[topic]"
```

### Phase 5.5: Write Compact Log (when COMPACT = true)

**Skip entirely if `COMPACT` is `false`.**

Append each completed experiment to `EXPERIMENT_LOG.md`:

```markdown
## [Run ID] — [timestamp]
- **System**: [method name]
- **Config**: [key hyperparameters]
- **Result**: [primary metric = X.XX]
- **Verdict**: [positive / negative / inconclusive]
- **Reproduce**: `python train.py --config configs/run_id.yaml --seed 42`
```

### Phase 5.6: Auto Ablation Planning

After main experiments (M2) complete with positive results, invoke `/ablation-planner` to design ablation studies:

- Read the main results and method description
- Generate a claim-driven ablation plan: which components to remove, what to compare, and expected outcomes
- Append ablation blocks to `refine-logs/EXPERIMENT_PLAN.md` and `refine-logs/EXPERIMENT_TRACKER.md`
- If main results are negative or inconclusive, skip ablation planning and note that in the summary

If `/ablation-planner` is unavailable, skip silently.

### Phase 6: Handoff

Present final status:

```
🔬 Experiment bridge complete:
- Implemented: [N] experiment scripts
- Deployed: [N] experiments on [M] GPUs
- Completed: [X/Y] must-run, [A/B] nice-to-have
- Main result: [one sentence]

Results: refine-logs/EXPERIMENT_RESULTS.md
Tracker: refine-logs/EXPERIMENT_TRACKER.md

Ready for Workflow 2:
→ /auto-review-loop "[topic]"
```

## Key Rules

- **Large file handling**: If the Write tool fails due to file size, immediately retry using Bash (`cat << 'EOF' > file`) to write in chunks. Do NOT ask the user for permission — just do it silently.
- **CRITICAL — Evaluation must use dataset ground truth.** Always compare model predictions against the dataset's actual labels/targets, never another model's output. If the task has official eval scripts, prefer them.
- **Follow the plan.** Do not invent experiments not in EXPERIMENT_PLAN.md. If you think something is missing, note it but don't add it.
- **Sanity first.** Never deploy a full suite without verifying the sanity stage passes.
- **Reuse existing code.** Scan the project before writing new scripts. Extend, don't duplicate.
- **Save everything as JSON/CSV.** The auto-review-loop needs parseable results, not just terminal output.
- **Update the tracker.** `EXPERIMENT_TRACKER.md` should reflect real status after each run completes.
- **Don't wait forever.** If an experiment exceeds 2x its estimated time, flag it and move on to the next milestone.
- **Budget awareness.** Track GPU-hours against the plan's budget. Warn if approaching the limit.
